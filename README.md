# perturbation_filtering
Converting a perturbation file of gene names and assigned values, filtering it to the genes that are one standard deviation above and below the given mean for a sample. Files are created containing these genes, "sample_name.high" and "sample_name.low" to denote the genes that are one standard deviation higher and lower than the mean for each sample
